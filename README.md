# **Miles to Kilometer Converter**

This program is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that allows users to convert distances from miles to kilometers. It is implemented using the Tkinter library in Python.

## Usage:

1. Launch the application.
2. Enter the distance in miles that you want to convert into the provided input field.
3. Click the "Calculate" button.
4. The equivalent distance in kilometers, rounded to the nearest whole number, will be displayed.

## Code Explanation

The code uses the Tkinter library to create a GUI window and various elements such as labels, entry fields, and buttons. The `miles_to_km` function is called when the "Calculate" button is clicked. It retrieves the value entered by the user, converts it to kilometers, and updates the result label.
